# A WORK IN PROGRESS

# ghactions-boilerplate
Just a repository intended to be used as a boilerplate that adds a github workflow running on every commit. 
It includes a linter (ESLint) verification step that must pass before a pull request can be merge.

### Requirements:
 - package.json with ESLint dependency
 - need a eslint configuration file which you can create by running: `npm init @eslint/config`. The one found in this repository is only intended to be used as an example.
